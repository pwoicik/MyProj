## Getting started

If you haven't already setup active developer directory run:
```shell
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

To setup the development environment run
```shell
./setup.sh
```
\
You may also want to install swiftformat-for-xcode.
```shell
brew install swiftformat-for-xcode
```
In that case you will have to import the config from .swiftformat file
(File -> Open -> .swiftformat).
